## General Information
* Personal, experimental project for learning C#
* Its kinda game related, but its not about performance (e.g. rendering with forms, instead of using OpenGL)
* It also contains some concepts based on my other project ([Lucid-Engine JavaScript](https://github.com/OxiAction/Lucid-Engine))

## Goals
* Use official [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
* Make good use of Publish / Subscribe pattern
* Lambda expressions
* Inheritance & Interfaces
* Warning-free Code
* Game Loop (migrated from my [Lucid-Engine JavaScript](https://github.com/OxiAction/Lucid-Engine))
* A* (A-Star) Algorithm for pathfinding (migrated from my [Lucid-Engine JavaScript](https://github.com/OxiAction/Lucid-Engine))
* Simple Demo Game
